Using django-simple-captcha
===========================

Installation
+++++++++++++

1. Download ``django-simple-captcha`` using pip_ by running: ``pip install  django-simple-captcha``
2. Add ``captcha`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``
3. Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` (or ``python manage.py migrate`` if you are managing databae migrations via South) to create the required database tables 
4. Add an entry to your ``urls.py``::

        urlpatterns += patterns('',
            url(r'^captcha/', include('captcha.urls')),
        )


.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

Adding to a Form
+++++++++++++++++

Using a ``CaptchaField`` is quite straight-forward:

Define the Form
----------------


To embed a CAPTCHA in your forms, simply add a ``CaptchaField`` to the form definition::

    from django import forms
    from captcha.fields import CaptchaField

    class CaptchaTestForm(forms.Form):
        myfield = AnyOtherField()
        captcha = CaptchaField()

â€¦or, as a ``ModelForm``::


    from django import forms
    from captcha.fields import CaptchaField

    class CaptchaTestModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
        captcha = CaptchaField()
        class Meta:
            model = MyModel

Validate the Form
-----------------

In your view, validate the form as usually: if the user didn't provide a valid response to the CAPTCHA challenge, the form will raise a ``ValidationError``::

    def some_view(request):
        if request.POST:
            form = CaptchaTestForm(request.POST)

            # Validate the form: the captcha field will automatically 
            # check the input
            if form.is_valid():
                human = True
        else:
            form = CaptchaTestForm()

        return render_to_response('template.html',locals())
